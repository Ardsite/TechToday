<p style="color:red""text-align:center;">Recent studies show that 95% of people's computers suffer from not having enough cpu (Central Processing Unit) cores. This is because most of todays commonly used programs and apps are designed around 6-8 core processors.
	Although, if this affects you, you do not need to buy a new computer. Programming expert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Nedra Muab</a> has created a simple program that unlocks up to 5 more cores in your cpu that most computer companies hide from the user,
	so that when they bring their slow computer into the store, they will unlock more cores procedeurly to keep the money coming.
	Nedra has released this program for free saying that people deserve to get what they are paying for, and that big companies should show their users more respect.</p>
